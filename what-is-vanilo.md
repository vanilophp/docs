# What Is Vanilo?

Vanilo is an **E-commerce Framework for Laravel**.

Vanilo is the obvious choice for Laravel Developers for building an E-commerce application with full control over the code.

## Is It A Ready-To-Use E-commerce Application?

Unlike WooCommerce or PrestaShop, the Vanilo Framework is not an application, but a set of prebuilt Laravel components.
You can utilize Vanilo either to:

1. add e-commerce features to an existing Laravel Application, or
2. to create a new Laravel E-commerce application.

> A standalone, ready-made Laravel application is coming in Q1 2025!

## Is It Ready For Production?

Yes.

Starting from as early as v0.2 there has been a well-defined [upgrade path](upgrade.md) up until the
current latest version.

Refer to [Release Notes](releases.md) for more details.

Every component is well-tested, and Vanilo uses the [Semantic Versioning Scheme](https://semver.org), meaning you won't
face unexpected breaking changes.

Shortly, because back in 2017 there was no decent one **particularly for Laravel**. There's a slightly
